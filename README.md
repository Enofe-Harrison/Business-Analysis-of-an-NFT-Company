The project aimed to recommend solutions to the company’s product sales in the NFT market. Using the datasets provided by the client, a series of exploratory data analyses and data visualization was done on the company and the NFT market, and a PowerPoint report was generated that contains the business analysis and  recommendations that the management may want to consider during the decision-making process.

**Company Problem Statement:**

Courtyard has over 1,000 assets currently on chain and stored in our Brink’s vault. These assets have been traded hundreds of times and many assets have also been redeemed through our redemption portal where a user will send us the NFT of the asset and we will send them back the physical asset and “burn” the NFT.
As a first priority, we are looking to better understand the market activity around our assets. We want to conduct an analysis of the initial sales, trades, and redemptions of our products. In particular, we want to dive into:
● Our first product drop of Pokemon cards, analysing the drop and the average royalty collected by card and total royalties for the project. This will include:
    ○ A deep dive into sealed vs. unsealed cards.
    ○ A review of how many assets were traded multiple times?
    ○ A review of what were the most traded assets?
    ○ A review of what was the average value of a traded asset vs. a held asset?

● In addition, given crypto markets crashed this year leading to many NFTs to drop hugely in value. We’d like to know how Courtyard assets fared during this time, and how our price changes in our assets compared to the overall market changes.

As a second priority: In addition to Courtyard Assets, Crypto and NFT markets have had a tough year. We’d like the student team to provide an analysis on the following topics:
● Overall Crypto market trading volume focusing on NFTs - If available, a small section on volume of other physically backed NFT companies would be a huge bonus.
● NFT value changes over the year in some of the most popular NFT projects on Opensea (BAYC, Bob-oms, etc.).

As a third priority: outside of crypto markets there are a huge amount of collectibles that trade online and offline as well. Courtyard wants to know which collectibles we should be prioritizing after trading cards, whether it be comics, coins, bottle caps, etc. An analysis on the topic of the most traded physical collectibles including:
● What assets in the physical collectible markets trade a lot? AKA, which assets have the highest trade to hold ratio?
● What is the physical collectible trading market overall volume by asset class?
● How can Courtyard think about our next product offering if we are looking to onboard assets that will bolster trading volume?
